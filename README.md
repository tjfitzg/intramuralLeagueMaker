Tyler Fitzgerald - Intramural League Maker - Example Web App

Hosted at: https://intramuralleaguemaker.herokuapp.com/#/
*Web App is still under regular development but hosted version is stable*

The intramural league maker can be used to create and manage "intramural" sport leagues. Administrators can create an account where they then manage a league or several leagues. The administrator creates teams, lays out the schedule, and then inputs the scores of each game. The web app handles the league standings and hosts all of the league records. The administrators simply need to supply the league players with a link to view the league at any time. Or a player can search for their league at the main page.

Technologies Used: 
This example web app uses a MEAN full-stack comprised of node.js on the back end, mongoDB for databse connectivity, express middlewear, and AngularJS for the front end. BootstrapJS is used for styling and so that the webapp can be used with a consistent look and feel across all devices (computers, phones, tablets, etc). Stormpath User identity API is used to manage the users. I have not enabled a social login, email verification, or restting of password wit Stormpath. This is so potential employers may create an account with a fake email and remain anonymous(remember your password).

NOTE: The idea for this is web app is not original. The purpose of this web app is entirely to serve as a proof of concept of web development capabilities. The web app is still under development. I started the web app in March and I am currently developing it whenever I have free time around my school work. If you find any bugs I would greatly appreciate it if you would let me know.
